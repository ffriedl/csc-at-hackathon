# csc-at-hackathon
Dear Colleagues,

here at CSC Austria, we believe that every employee possesses amazing ideas and creativity. Hackathons are a longstanding tradition in IT where our developers, architects and engineers spend some hours to create a working product or prototype from scratch. Remember- done is better than perfect.

Join the mobility Team at 1PM CET in the Vienna office big conference room as we spend the hours prior to the CSC Summer Party hacking, learning and having some fun! Start brainstorming ideas & forming teams! We will supply drinks and snacks, fun diversions and some cool stuff too, like a Parrot AR2 drone, Leap Motion sensor and Kinect sensor to incorporate into your solution. You bring your laptop, skills and creative ideas. 



1. The solution has to incorporate the drone.
2. The solution has to incorporate an uncommon approach to piloting the drone.
3. The solution has to push data (whatever data) including meta data from the drone automatically to a CSC cloud in a secure way.
4. It would be nice if the solution would make the drone data stored in the cloud accessible on mobile devices.
5, It would be nice if the data could be used in some form of big data approach.
